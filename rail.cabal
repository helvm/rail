Name:               rail
Version:            0.0.1
Synopsis:           An esoteric language using train tracks for control flow.
Description:        Rail is a stack-based programming language, created by
                    Jonathon Duerig, where each function's control flow is
                    laid out using a sort of ASCII art to draw tracks, along
                    which a virtual train travels. This library and executable
                    provide an interpreter, as well as a simple compiler to
                    a C backend.
